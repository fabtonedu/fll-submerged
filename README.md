## 🤖 Robot Game – Strategy, Engineering & Execution

The **Robot Game** was approached with three distinct strategies during the season — each developed from scratch for a specific competition round:

### 📍 Phase 1 – Regional Strategy
Our first iteration focused on stability and mission coverage. Each team member contributed separate strategies that were later unified into a shared mission plan.

### 📍 Phase 2 – National Strategy
We completely restarted after Regionals. A new chassis, attachments, and program logic were introduced. Design was modular, built for speed and swap efficiency. Documentation was enhanced and testing made systematic.

### 📍 Phase 3 – APOC Strategy (Final)
The most advanced and refined version of our system:
- Built from scratch based on lessons learned
- Fully redesigned attachments 
- Modular, commented Python code (Pybricks on Spike Prime)
- Attachment building instructions in Studio 2.0
- Full analytics: tracked tests, iteration logs, decision-making

Each strategy phase is documented separately in its own folder for clarity. Run plans, Studio files, and all supporting materials are available here.
